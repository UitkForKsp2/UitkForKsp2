# Making your UI

<!--Writerside adds this topic when you create a new documentation project.
You can use it as a sandbox to play with Writerside features, and remove it from the TOC when you don't need it anymore.-->

## Add new topics
You can create empty topics, or choose a template for different types of content that contains some boilerplate structure to help you get started
